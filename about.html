    <h1><strong>About Us</strong></h1>
        <p>We are a small company owned by two women who have grown up and lived on the East Coast their entire lives, who have a passion for design and everything that makes New England special. Co-owners <i>Martha Whitherby</i> and <i>Elizabeth Johnson</i>, met while both were earning their Masters of Fine Arts from The New School. While both can offer different styles or tastes depending on the client, each can work with clients to bring that New England style to your home, wardrobe, and more.</p>
